DISCOVERING AWS MIGRATION HUB 

Central location to gather application and server inventory information
Enables you to assess, plan and track migrations to AWS 
Logically group service together for migration 
A central place to manage the migration of applications and data into AWS 

Integrated with other Migration services like Application Discovery and Migration Service, with DMS 
Make recommendations about modernising applications 
Replatform java or .net applications to run as docker containers in Elastic Container Service 
Estimate the cost of running your existing workload on EC2 instances in AWS
