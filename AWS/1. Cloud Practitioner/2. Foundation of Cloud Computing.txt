GET YOUR HEAD IN THE CLOUD -

What is the Cloud -
    AWS has thousands of servers grouped together called Datacenters and Scattered in different countries
    https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/data-centers/
    AWS uses virtualization of servers to divide memory of each server into smaller parts
    Each Server has multiple Virtual Machines. Each VM has its own OS, memory. 
    On-Demand and and Pay-As-You-Go 

What is Cloud Computing -
It is the delivery of computing services over the internet
Compute Services                    -   EC2
Storage Services                    -   S3

INTRODUCING CLOUD COMPUTING AND DEPLOYMENT MODELS -

- CapEx vs OpEx
- Cloud Computing Advantages and Benefits
- Cloud Computing Models
- Cloud Deployment Models
- Exam Tips 

- CapEx(Capital Expenditures) vs OpEx(Operating Expenses)
CapEx are upfront purchases towards fixed assets(Equipment, Property, Computer and Sofware)
OpEx are funds used to run day-to-day operations(Employee Salary, Marketing, Rent and RnD)

- Cloud Computing Advantages 
Global in Minutes(We can deploy our applications around the world on click of a button)
No Data Center Spend(Focus on Application instead of managing hardware)
Economies of Scale
Speed and Agility 
Stop Guessing Capacity
CapEx for Variable Expense 
- Benefits
High Availability
Agility
Elasticity
Durability

- Cloud Computing Models
Infrastructure as a Service -   It is like a Building block that can be rented and we can choose how to put them together. 
                                Eg - Having a monthly subscription with a hosting company that serves a website
Software as a Service       -   Using a complete Application on demand that someone offers to users.
                                Eg - Personal Email that we access using a browser
Platform as a Service       -   Used by Developers to help develop softwares using web based tools without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
                                Ex - Tools provided to build applications that runs on another company's server

- Cloud Deployment Models
Private Cloud       -   Resources like servers and databases are all on-premises. 
                        Local network/Private cloud is our internal data center.
                        Private cloud don't have any advantages that we learnt
                        But it offers more security to our data that is not traversing public place and not shared with other organisations ith virtualization
Public Cloud        -   This is AWS, Azure and GCP
                        No hardware responsibility, has all advantages of the cloud
Hybrid Cloud        -   Public + Private Cloud
                        Sensitive data is stored locally and safely connected to public cloud like AWS using services like VPN and Direct Connect 
                        VPN can create a secure connection into a public cloud(Eg - Creating a new resources in AWS)
                        Direct Connect creates a secure connection for data to move from public cloud to private cloud outtraversing the public internet

- Exam Tips 
Six Advantages, Cloud Benefits and Terminology
Computing models IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Deployment Models Private, Public, Hybrid Cloud(Hybrid cloud supported by Direct Connect)

EXPLORING REGIONS AND AVAILABILITY ZONES

- AWS Regions
- Region Characteristics
- AWS Availability Zones
- Availability Zones Characteristics
- Exam Tips 

- AWS Regions and Characteristics
AWS Region is a physical location
AWS groups their Regions by geographical locations and can include several regions within each location 
Eg - Ohio & N. Virginia regions resides under US East geographical location
Regions are fully independent and isolated, If one region is impacted by earthquake then others will not be
Regions are Service and Resource specific means they are isolated and Resources are not automatically replicated across them

- AWS Availability Zones
AWS Region consists of multiple Availability Zones
AWS AZ consists of one or more physically separated data centers. Each data centre is housed in different facilities
AZ are One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity in an AWS Region

- AZ Characteristics
They are connected with low latency links
They are Fault tolerant
High Availability

- Exam Tips
Region is global and is made up of two or more AZs
AZ is made up of multiple data centers
Multi AZ Deployment provide high availability
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

REVIEWING EDGE LOCATIONS AND LOCAL ZONES

- Latency Exlained
- Local Zones
- Edge Locations
- Exam Tips

- Latency Explained
Latency is the amount is takes for a website to load 
The time that passes between a user request and the resulting response

- Local Zones
Local Zones place AWS services like compute, storage, databases and others closer to end-users
This allows for any demanding application that require millisecond latencies
Eg - For real time gaming
Local Zones are extensions to AWS Regions and provide high bandwidth and secure connections

- Edge Locations
Edge Locations can help to reduce latency.
They are not used for launch resources but instead to cache content for faster delivery to users
It is a feature provided by CloudFront(Content Delivery and Networking) service. It uses AWS Backbone network
There are more Edge Locations than Regions or AZs

- Tips
Edge Locations ensure low latency by placing content closer to users
Local Zone is an extension of a Region enabling things like real-time gaming

MEETING THE AWS MANAGEMENT CONSOLE AND ACCESSING AWS

- The AWS Management Console 
- Root User 
- The AWS Command Line Interface(CLI)
- Exam Tips 

- The AWS Management Console
AWS website home page is Management Console

- Root User
It is initially created when you setup the AWS account. It is the only account that have full permission of everything
Step 1  -   Enable MFA for Root user. Create a new user/group to use for day-to-day task in IAM service

- The AWS CLI
CLI is generally used by Developers, Engineers and Resources through commands
CLI have features before it comes in Management Console. CLI gives us programmatic access 
CLI uses a terminal session to access resources programmatically
Other ways to get programmatic access include Application Code with SDKs using programmatic calls
SDKs can access resources using programming languages(Java, Python, C# and more)

- Tips
Root user must be protected by MFA and must not be used for daily tasks
The Root user has power that no other user has
CLI and SDKs are other options to manage AWS resources
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

DEMO: EXPLORING YOUR AWS ACCOUNT 

- Scenario
- Demonstration
- Exam Tips

- Scenario
You have been tasked with creating a new AWS account and securing the root user. 
You will need to create a user for your team to utilize daily.

Create AWS account, Secure the Root User, Create a daily user
https://aws.amazon.com/console/
Create an Account , Add MFA for root
Go to IAM > Access Management > Users > Create User > "AWSFoundation"
    Provide user access to AWS Management Console > Create an IAM user > Password "AWS@Foundation"
    Provide policies > "AdministratorAccess" > Create User
    Logout from root user and login to IAM user
