GET YOUR HEAD IN THE CLOUD -

What is the Cloud -
    AWS has thousands of servers grouped together called Datacenters and Scattered in different countries
    https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-center/data-centers/
    AWS uses virtualization of servers to divide memory of each server into smaller parts
    Each Server has multiple Virtual Machines. Each VM has its own OS, memory. 
    On-Demand and and Pay-As-You-Go 

What is Cloud Computing -
It is the delivery of computing services over the internet
Compute Services                    -   EC2
Storage Services                    -   S3
Networking Services                 -   VPC
Database Services                   -   RDS
Development, Messaging and Deployment
Migration and Transfer              -   Migration Hub
AI and ML                           -   Recognition
Auditing, Monitoring and Logging    -   Truted Adviser
Security, Compliance and Governance -   IAM
Pricing, Billing and Support        -   Pricing Calculator

INTRODUCING CLOUD COMPUTING AND DEPLOYMENT MODELS -

- CapEx vs OpEx
- Cloud Computing Advantages and Benefits
- Cloud Computing Models
- Cloud Deployment Models
- Exam Tips 

- CapEx(Capital Expenditures) vs OpEx(Operating Expenses)
CapEx are upfront purchases towards fixed assets(Equipment, Property, Computer and Sofware)
OpEx are funds used to run day-to-day operations(Employee Salary, Marketing, Rent and RnD)

- Cloud Computing Advantages 
Global in Minutes(We can deploy our applications around the world on click of a button)
No Data Center Spend(Focus on Application instead of managing hardware)
Economies of Scale
Speed and Agility 
Stop Guessing Capacity
CapEx for Variable Expense 
- Benefits
High Availability
Agility
Elasticity
Durability

- Cloud Computing Models
Infrastructure as a Service -   It is like a Building block that can be rented and we can choose how to put them together. 
                                Eg - Having a monthly subscription with a hosting company that serves a website
Software as a Service       -   Using a complete Application on demand that someone offers to users.
                                Eg - Personal Email that we access using a browser
Platform as a Service       -   Used by Developers to help develop softwares using web based tools without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
                                Ex - Tools provided to build applications that runs on another company's server

- Cloud Deployment Models
Private Cloud       -   Resources like servers and databases are all on-premises. 
                        Local network/Private cloud is our internal data center.
                        Private cloud don't have any advantages that we learnt
                        But it offers more security to our data that is not traversing public place and not shared with other organisations ith virtualization
Public Cloud        -   This is AWS, Azure and GCP
                        No hardware responsibility, has all advantages of the cloud
Hybrid Cloud        -   Public + Private Cloud
                        Sensitive data is stored locally and safely connected to public cloud like AWS using services like VPN and Direct Connect 
                        VPN can create a secure connection into a public cloud(Eg - Creating a new resources in AWS)
                        Direct Connect creates a secure connection for data to move from public cloud to private cloud outtraversing the public internet

- Exam Tips 
Six Advantages, Cloud Benefits and Terminology
Computing models IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
Deployment Models Private, Public, Hybrid Cloud(Hybrid cloud supported by Direct Connect)
