- What is EC2

- EBS/EFS(Amazon Elastic Block Store/ Elastic File System)
EBS -
EBS is like oven in kitchen, it is directly attached and reliable 
Features EBS-
High Availability and Durable - Suited for EC2 instances, Ensures data is preserved even if the instance crashes
Scalability - Expands on-the-fly without any downtime
Snapshot - Can take backups and also use these backups to create new volumes
Use Cases EBS -
Hosting relational or NoSQL database
Data warehousing and big data analytics
ERP and CRM applications
EFS -
Features -
Fully managed - Removes the complexity of deploying and maintaining file systems. 
Automatic Scaling - Automatically scales on demand without disrupting applications
Concurrent Access - Multiple EC2 instances can access an EFS system simultaneously
Use Case -
Growing web app like Content Management and web serving
Data analytics applications
Development and testing environments 

- Instance Store
Temporary block level storage directly attached to EC2 instance
Features -
High I/O Performance - Offers very high input/output operations per second
Temporary Storage - Data is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated
No extra cost - They comes as part of the instance 
Use cases -
Temporqry storage pf cache and buffers
Write and discard large amounts of data
Storage for applications that replicate data across multiple instances

- Tips
Understand the Differences between EBS, EFS and Instance stores
Know the differences in Dirability and Persostance, Performance and Cost


AMAZON SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE(S3): THE BIGGER PICTURE

- What is S3
- Benefits of S3
- Use Cases
- Exam Tips

- What is S3
S3 is like refrigerator to store ingredients. In refrigerator we have buckets. Each bucket contains specific ingredients
Similarly Bucket is our primary container and inside it we have objects, each object has some metadata

- Benefits of S3
99.99999999999% Durable upto 9 digits
Scalable - Virtually unlimited
Security - Bucket policies, Access control lists
Versatility - Stor images, videos, backups and big data 

- Use cases 
Data Backup, Web hosting, Content Distribution(CloudFront), Data Lakes

- Tips
S3 is object storage holding both data and metadata
Each object in S3 has data, a unique key and metadata

EXPLORING S3 STORAGE CLASSES

- Standard
- Intelligent-Tiering
- Infrequent Access
- Glacier

Storage classes are objects defined for specific needs

- S3 Standard
It is primary shelf of refrigerator used for frequently asked data 
High Throughput(it cam scale automatocally), Low Latency

- S3 Intelligent Tiering
Dynamic shelf of refrigerator, used for unpredictable data 
Automatically moves data, Savings

- S3 Standard Infrequent Access
Accessed less frequenty but required Rapid Access when needed
It has a retrieval fee
S3 One Zone Infrequent Access - Special Storage available in only one AZ
Cost effective but less durable. Used for secondary backup or for data that is easily reproducable 

- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
Top door in fridger, quickly access important ingredients that are not used often 
Designed for immediate access to archieve data as it is a archieve storage class that offers lowest cost storage for long lived data that is rarely accessed and require Instant retrieval in ms
Archieve Storage, Instant Retrieval

- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
Another apartment in deep freezer that is not active as much 
Accessed one to two times a year
Achieve Storage, Not Immediate

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Bottom part of deep freezer, most effective for long time archieval, designed for customers in highly regulated industries like healthcare and public sectors that retain datasets from 7 to 10 years or longer to meet regutory compliance.
Retrieval can take upto 12 hrs
Archieve Storage, Slow


DEMO: EXPLORING STORAGE SERVICES: S3 IN ACTION

- Key Concepts
- Demo 

- Concepts 
Sacurity including bucket policies, IAM policies and encryption

- Demo
Bucket name should be globally unique, Default permission is to block all access, Encryption is by default
Properties contains versioning, Permission contains policies, Management contains lifecycle policy to move object between storage classes through lifecycle rule actions


INTRODUCING ADDITIONAL STORAGE SERVICES

- FSx
- Elastic Disaster Recovery

- FSx 
Specially designed storage shelf require specific conditions
Fully managed Windows File System crafted for Windows Specific Workloads
Built on Windows Server

- Elastic Disaster Recovery
Backup generator for pizza kitchen
Minimize downtime and Dataloss, Quick recovery Times and. ost Effective Solution
Pay only for servers that we are replicating 
Scenarios where Operation disruptions can be costly, Elastic Disaster recoverey proves valuable
It maintains Business Continuity, Protects data from loss and is flexible and adaptable


AMAZON ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE STORE(EBS)

- EBS Features
- EBS Volume Types
- Snapshots

- EBS Features
Persistent Storage - Data remains intact after stopping EC2 instance.
High Availability and Durability - Data is automatically replicated within its availability zone
Scalable - Volume can be resized as data grows
Encrypted - Data at rest and in transit is secure
Snapshot - Can take backups and also ise these backups to create new volumes

- EBS Volume Types 
SSD Backed Volumes - Solid state drive, Faster, More Expensive, Ideal for high IOPS(no of read write operations per second)
HDD Backed Volumes - Hard disk drive, Slower, Less Expensive, Ideal for throughput(measurement of bits or bytes per second) tasks
General Purpose SSD vs Provisioned IOPS SSD -
General - gp3 and gp2, Low latency interactive applications, 16000 max IOPS, Multi attach not supported
Provisioned - io2, io1, io2 block express. High IOPS, 64000 to 256000, Multi attach supported
Throughput Optimized HDD vs Cold HDD volumes -
Throughput - st1, Big Data, 500 Max IOPS, 500 MiB/s max throughput
Cold - sc1, Lower storage cost, 250, 250 MiB/s max throughput

- Snapshots
Capture perfect moment, preseve it and use it in future
Incremental Backup - Each snapshot only saves changes sunce the last one
Restore and Launch - Use snapshots to quickly restore a volume
Share or Sell - Snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts
Cost Effective - Snapshots only store block level changes
Cross region replication - Snapshots can be copied across AWS regions
