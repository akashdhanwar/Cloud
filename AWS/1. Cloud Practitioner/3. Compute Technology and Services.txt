- Compute Overview
There is a free tier for EC2 
Compute is used to describe Concepts and Services geared towards Computation and Processing
CPU, GPU are included in this
EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute(These are virtual servers in the cloud). It can grow/shrink
EC2 is a foundational service that we use to manage our virtual instances
It allows us to provision them on single click of a button/template called AMI(Amazon Machine Image)
AMI has important information including OS 
Uses of EC2
    We can also directly deploy our applications to EC2 instance using multiple AZs for high availability
    Use EC2 as a database to have full control over the database
EC2 offers 6 families of instances that are broken into types, generation and sizes which makes up 100 of options
Families include    
    General Purpose
    Compute Oriented
    Memory Optimized
    Accelerated Computing
    Storage Optimized
    High Performance Computing(HPC) Optimized
Pricing for EC2 
    On Demand       -   Fixed Price billed by the second
                        Use when-   Low costs, no upfront payments or commitments
                                    Cannot interrupt unpredictable workloads
                                    Developing applications (Think on Demand)
                                    Workload wont run longer than a year
                        Capacity Reservations hold capacity whether or not you run an instance
                        Capacity Reservations   -   High Avvailability, Disaster Recovery, Capacity Assurance
    Spot instances  -   Takes advantage of unused EC2 capacity
                        Use when-   Not concerned with start or stop times
                                    Can interrupt workload 
                                    Very low compute prices are needed
                                    CHEAPEST OPTION
                        Pay the price in effect at the beginning of the hour and save up to 90% off On-Demand prices
    Dedicated Hosts -   Pay for a physical server that is fully dedicated to running your instances
                        Use when-   Bring your own server-bound software license like Microsoft or Oracle
                                    Regulatory or corporate compliance requirements around tenacy
                        Up to 70% off On-Demand prices. No sharing your server with other customers.
                        Dedicated Hosts = Physical Servers. Dedicated instances runs on Dedicated Host
    Reserved Instances- RI Commit to a specific instance type for 1 to 3 years
                        Use when-   Steady stage usage and can commit 
                                    Pay money upfront
                                    Application requires a capacity reservation 
                        Up to 72% off On-Demand prices with a CONTRACT. Reserve capacity in ana AZ for any duration
                        Pay all, partial or no upfront, but all upfront offers the highest discount
                        Convert instance types at 66% discount
    Savings Plans   -   Commit to compute usage for 1 to 3 years(measured per hour)
                        Use when-   Lower your bill across multiple compute services like EC2, Lambda
                                    Flexibility to change compute services, instance types, OS, or Regions
                        72% off On-Demand prices
                        Share savings across compute services
                        No capacity reservations 

- Tips
Know the EC2 Pricing options    -   On-Demand, Spot, Dedicated Hosts, RI, Savings Plan
Understand the real world usage of EC2  -   Deploying a database or a web application

REVIEWING EC2 FEATURES 

- Load Balancing
- Auto Scaling 
- Compute Optimizer
- Exam Tips 

- Load Balancing
There are 4 load balancer types
Classic - Best used for EC2 Classic network and Layer 4/7. It uses TCP, SSL/TLS and HTTP/HTTPS protocol listeners
Application - Provides flexible application management at Layer 7. It uses HTTP/HTTPS/GRPC protocols
Gateway - Best used for network logging and monitoring with third-party virtual appliances, Layer 3 as a gateway and Layer 4 as load balancer. It works at gateway level, hence only have IP protocol listeners hence not used for any other use case
Network - Extreme performance and static IP address at Layer 4 which includes TCP/UDP/TLS protocol

- Auto Scaling
Adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs
There are 2 types of autoscaling
