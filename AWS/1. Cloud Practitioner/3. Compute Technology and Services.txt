- Compute Overview
There is a free tier for EC2 
Compute is used to describe Concepts and Services geared towards Computation and Processing
CPU, GPU are included in this
EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute(These are virtual servers in the cloud). It can grow/shrink
EC2 is a foundational service that we use to manage our virtual instances
It allows us to provision them on single click of a button/template called AMI(Amazon Machine Image)
AMI has important information including OS 
Uses of EC2
    We can also directly deploy our applications to EC2 instance using multiple AZs for high availability
    Use EC2 as a database to have full control over the database
EC2 offers 6 families of instances that are broken into types, generation and sizes which makes up 100 of options
Families include    
    General Purpose
    Compute Oriented
    Memory Optimized
    Accelerated Computing
    Storage Optimized
    High Performance Computing(HPC) Optimized

                        Dedicated Hosts = Physical Servers. Dedicated instances runs on Dedicated Host
    Reserved Instances- RI Commit to a specific instance type for 1 to 3 years
                        Use when-   Steady stage usage and can commit 
                                    Pay money upfront
                                    Application requires a capacity reservation 
                        Up to 72% off On-Demand prices with a CONTRACT. Reserve capacity in ana AZ for any duration
                        Pay all, partial or no upfront, but all upfront offers the highest discount
                        Convert instance types at 66% discount
    Savings Plans   -   Commit to compute usage for 1 to 3 years(measured per hour)
                        Use when-   Lower your bill across multiple compute services like EC2, Lambda
                                    Flexibility to change compute services, instance types, OS, or Regions
                        72% off On-Demand prices
                        Share savings across compute services
                        No capacity reservations

REVIEWING EC2 FEATURES 

- Load Balancing
- Auto Scaling 
- Compute Optimizer
- Exam Tips 

- Load Balancing
There are 4 load balancer types
Classic - Best used for EC2 Classic network and Layer 4/7. It uses TCP, SSL/TLS and HTTP/HTTPS protocol listeners
Application - Provides flexible application management at Layer 7. It uses HTTP/HTTPS/GRPC protocols
Gateway - Best used for network logging and monitoring with third-party virtual appliances, Layer 3 as a gateway and Layer 4 as load balancer. It works at gateway level, hence only have IP protocol listeners hence not used for any other use case
Network - Extreme performance and static IP address at Layer 4 which includes TCP/UDP/TLS protocol

- Auto Scaling
Adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs
There are 2 types of autoscaling
Horizontal - Scaling out. Reduces the impact of system failures and improves availability as it uses multiple AZs and adds or removes instances.
Vertical - Scaling Up. Upgrades EC2 instances to add more power/cpu/ram to an existing server. Eg - T3 small to T3 medium

- Compute Optimizer
It helps to RightSize instances, volumes, containers or lambda functions based on data from our usage.
It also provides recommendations on how to improve performance and identify underprovisioned/overprovisioned resources. 
Configure external metrics. 
Streamline migration to AWS Graviton CPUs.

- Tips
Difference between Horizontal and Vertical scaling
Benefits of auto scaling

CONTAINERS: THE BIGGER PICTURE

- Containers Overview
- Containers on AWS
- Quiz
- Exam Tips

- Containers Overview
Container holds Application or Services. We can stack multiple containers on a single server
Benefits - Portability, Operational consistency, Efficiency, Accelerate Application Development Cycles, Less overhead
Use Cases - Lift and shift of existing applications into cloud architectures, Refactoring applications, Support for microservice architecture, Support for CI/CD deployments, Easier deployment of repetitive tasks

- Containers on AWS
It Uses -
Elastic Container Registry(ECR) - Store Deploy and Store container software
Elastic Container Service(ECS) - Fully managed and serverless using Fargate
ECS supports Docker and Docker compose CLI
Elastic Kubernetes Service(EKS) - Kubernetes is open source system
EKS support Kubernetes
Similarities -
They both take from ECR and makes the application and puts it in a box or container. They both Deploy Manage and Scale application 
Both can run with EC2, Fargate, Outposts or ECS anywhere. But EKS can also run using Local Zones and Wavelength

- Quiz 
You need to use docker to manage your newly deployed container based application. Which AWS service can help you manage the app?     ECS

- Tips
Know the differences between ECS and EKS
Understand realworld usage of containers


SERVERLESS SERVICES: THE BIGGER PICTURE

- What is Serverless
- Lambda Overview
- Fargate Overview
- Exam Tips

- What is Serverless
Serverless is a cloud needed development model without managing servers.

- Lambda Overview
It is a Serverless Compute Service and the code we write is called a function
Lambda scales automatically
Use Case -
Real-Time File Processing - We have a file that we upload to S3 bucket, it can trigger a Lambda function and upload it to dynamodb table to store that data 
Sending Email Notifications - Any chages made to our file using Code commit. We can use Cloudwatch to trigger a lambda function to trigger SNS to trigger email
Backend Business Logic - Alexa Skill to trigger Lambda function to retrieve information from dynamodb and send back info to alexa using another lambda trigger

- Fargate Overview
Pay-as-you-go auto scaling compute engine
To use, select/build container image and define memory and compute resources, Run and manage containers
It has isolation by design
Fargate is a launch type in ECS for containers as is EC2
Use Case -
Message driven workloads - Suppose a SQS(Simple Queue Servicequeue) that fargate uses to long pull messages. Fargate processes and stores it in dynamodb
Lambda is used for short and redundant tasks. If Process is greater than 15 minutes then Fargate is good
Event Driven and Scheduled Workloads

- Tips
Know when to use serverless service like lambda
Fargate is considered serverless and used to manage containers


UNDERSTANDING SERVERLESS PRICING AND FEATURES
