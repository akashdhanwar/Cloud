WHAT IS CI/CD 

- What is CI/CD 
- Benefits 

- What is CI/CD
It is a Software development best practice
The idea is to Automate everything. Example - Code integration, build, test and deployment 
It makes change easy by Applying multiple small changes each day

- Benefits
Automation                          -   Fast, Repeatable and scalable
Manual Effort Avoided               -   Slow, Error prone, inconsistent Effort Avoided
Small Changes Applied frequently    -   Catch bugs while they are small and simple to fix

AWS DEPLOYMENT TOOLS 

- AWS CodeCommit
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodeDeploy
- AWS CodePipeline
- Exam Tips

- AWS CodeCommit(For Merging)
Source Control service enabling terms to collaborate on code, html pages, scripts, images and binaries.
It is a central code repository just like Private git repo in the cloud

- AWS CodeBuild(For Preparing)
Compiles source code, runs tests and produces packages that are ready to deploy
It takes code from CodeCommit and use code to build deployable artifacts.
Artifacts like packages/docker images   -   .net core package, docker image, Node.js package 

- AWS CodeDeploy(For Deployment)
Automated Deploy service to deploy sofware to EC2 instances/ On Premises systems/ Lambda
Release features, avoids downtime and reduces risk with process 

- AWS CodePipeline(Overall Process)
End-to-end solution, build, test and deploy your application every time there is a code change
Automated CI/CD pipeline

DEMO: WORKING WITH AWS CLOUDSHELL AND THE AWS CLI 

Scenario
You have been tasked with creating an S3 bucket and uploading a file. 
You would like to accomplish this using the AWS CLI running in the CloudShell instead of using the console 

1   -   Launch the CloudShell           -   Console like Icon is on top bar
                                        -   CloudShell is a browser based shell with CLI pre-installed
2   -   Use the AWS CLI                 -   'aws --version'
                                        -   'aws s3 mb s3://BucketName' (Make Bucket)
                                        -   'aws s3 ls' (List buckets)
                                        -   'echo "My new File" >> fileName.txt'
                                        -   'ls'
                                        -   'cat fileName.txt'
                                        -   'aws s3 cp fileName.txt s3://BucketName' (Copy)
                                        -   'aws s3 ls s3://BucketName'
3   -   Review the CLI Documentation    -   'aws s3 mb help'
                                        -   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest

DEMO: USING AWS CLOUD9

Scenario 
You are a developer.
You need an IDE platform that lets you write, run and debug your code
That supports the most popular programming languages like JS, Python, Ruby, C++ and lets you run AWS CLI commands

Cloud9 is an integrated IDE that we can use inside of our browser. It comes with AWS CLI

1   -   Create a Cloud9 environment     -   Search for Cloud9 in Management Console
                                        -   Create an environment(My-IDE), New EC2, t3.small, Linux 2, Create
                                        -   We can open it through Open link and it will open IDE
2   -   Explore Cloud9 Code Editor
3   -   Run some AWS CLI commands       -   Create a S3 bucket and copy file to the bucket from IDE

UNDERSTANDING AWS CODE ARTIFACT

It is an Artifact repository It makes it easy for developers to find the softare packages they need
A package is a bundle of software
Includes open-source and in-house developed software
It lets developer to securely store, publish and share softare packages that we need for software development process
Example -   Maven, NPM, Python packages

Scenario    -   Multiple Development Teams
Enables developers to get correct version of software packages like npm 

Artifacts includes Documentation, Compiled applications, Deployable packages and Libraries
