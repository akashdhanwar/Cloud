1)  AWS Cloud Practitioner 2019": AWS Cloud & the Value Proposition

- Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Advantages      -   No need for large upfront investments
                    No need to spend time managing hardware
                    Provision the exact computing resource
Four Services   -   Servers, Storage, Database, Application services 
Other Services  -   ML AI, Blockchain, AR VR, IoT, Analytics, Robotics

- Types of Cloud Computing/Service Models -   IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
IaaS            -   Networking Infra including high speed connection between data centres
                    Compute services(Server based/Serverless), running code in the Cloud
                    Storage and Database services
                    Example - AWS Virtual Private Cloud
PaaS            -   Customers still do not manage/control AWS infrastructure
                    Control Applications and Services
                    Created using Programming languages, libraries, services and tools
                    Some services are managed by AWS
                    .net, java, python, ruby, go, json, yaml
                    Example - Amazon Lightsail, Aurora
SaaS            -   Uses Applications running on a cloud infrastructure
                    Example - Gmail

Database as a Service(DBaaS - Google Cloud Platform)
Security as a Service(MSSP - Cisco, Splunk)
Function as a Service(FaaS - MS Azure functions, Lambda functions)
Containers as a Servoce(CaaS - Docker, Kubernetes on cloud)
Malware as a Service(MaaS)

- Cloud Deployment Models   -   Public, Private, Community, Hybrid Cloud
Public Cloud Deployment     -   Provisioned for Open use by general public and various consumer organizations
                                May be owned, managed and operated by an entity yet exists entirely on the premises of the cloud provider
                                AWS GCP MSAzure IBMCloud OracleCloud
Private Cloud Deployment    -   May be on-premises or off-premises at a provider
                                Provisioned for exclusive use
                                Often disconnected from the internet or public networks
                                No giving up control, privacy and Security
                                May be necessary due to regulations
Community Cloud Deployment  -   Exclusive use by specific community of consumers
                                Shared Mission, Policy, Compliance, Security
Hybrid Cloud Deployment     -   Combination of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures
                                Bound together by proprietary or standardized technology
                                Used in disaster recovery and cloud bursting
                                May need to keep assets and applications private for mission-criticality or Compliance
                                SaaS is not a Hybrid cloud
                                Example - Amazon Outpost
